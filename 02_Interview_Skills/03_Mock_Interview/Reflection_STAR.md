## Situation
During a simulated **mock interview** session, I participated in a realistic job interview scenario organized through my professional readiness program.

## Task
To apply the communication, posture, and confidence skills I had practiced and demonstrate readiness for actual interviews.

## Action
I treated the mock interview as a real one: researched the company, dressed professionally, and used STAR responses for behavioral questions. I focused on maintaining calm body language and strong eye contact.

## Result
Feedback from peers and mentors showed improvement in articulation and composure. The exercise prepared me for real interview environments and taught me to manage anxiety effectively.
