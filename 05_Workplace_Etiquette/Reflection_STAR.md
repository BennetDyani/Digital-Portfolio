## Situation
I engaged in professional environments during interviews, team projects, and my Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) placement.

## Task
To demonstrate professionalism, teamwork, ethical behavior, and adaptability in various workplace scenarios.

## Action
For my first job interview, I dressed formally in a white shirt and tie, though the interviewer’s relaxed tone helped me adjust and stay composed.  
In team projects and at my WIL company, I collaborated respectfully, addressed conflicts calmly, and maintained open communication. When peers underperformed, I spoke with them directly or escalated issues responsibly.  
I consistently addressed colleagues by their titles and applied professional communication skills learned in my coursework.

## Result
I learned that the workplace requires maturity, mindfulness, and awareness of company culture. I also understood the importance of boundaries—knowing when to seek help and when to say no to overload.
