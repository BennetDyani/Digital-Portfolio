## Situation
I participated in several interviews for software-related roles. The first ones were tense, but I improved as I practiced.

## Task
My objective was to enhance my confidence, clarity, and professionalism during interviews and apply best practices like the STAR method.

## Action
I practiced through **role-play** with a friend acting as the interviewer and used **ChatGPT** for simulated sessions. I researched each company thoroughly and adjusted my body posture, gestures, and tone to reflect confidence and professionalism.

## Result
After multiple practices, I passed one real interview. I learned that preparation and authenticity matter more than memorized answers. Being myself while staying professional made communication flow naturally.

## Evidence
